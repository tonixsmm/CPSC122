I'VE BEEN HAVING A HARD TIME ADJUSTING  
I HAD THE SHINIEST WHEELS, NOW THEY'RE RUSTING  
I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU'D CARE IF I CAME BACK  
I HAVE A LOT OF REGRETS ABOUT THAT  
PULLED THE CAR OFF THE ROAD TO THE LOOKOUT  
COULD'VE FOLLOWED MY FEARS ALL THE WAY DOWN  
AND MAYBE I DON'T QUITE KNOW WHAT TO SAY
