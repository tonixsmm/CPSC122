## Notes on Test Files

### English to Morse
I use `english_test.txt` as the read file and `morse.txt` as the write file.

I use `morse_test.txt` as the read file and `morse.txt` as the write file. Both files have been changed with different contents and they work perfectly fine with my current coding environment (Mac with G++/Clang compiler).
